## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: HSL hue of 210 to match the seriousness of safety; saturated at 50% to project authority; lightened to 60% brightness for good legibility on a light background. RGB: #4DB3FF
- Background color: a similar hue as the primary color to create harmony; highly desaturated to only 20% saturation; and lightened to 90% brightness for a professional and clean look. RGB: #E5F2FF
- Accent color: an analogous color created by shifting the primary hue 30 degrees to the 'left' to 180; adjust the saturation and brightness for contrast. RGB: #4DFFB3
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a modern, neutral, and objective feel suitable for workplace applications.
- Use clear and universally recognizable safety icons for quick identification of topics.
- Use a clean, tab-based layout for the quiz and report sections for clear navigation.
- Subtle transitions between quiz questions to avoid overwhelming the user.
